To create a backup of our AWS instance, we use volume snapshots through the AWS management console.

Creating a snapshot:

1.) Log into the AWS management console and navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
2.) Make sure you set the region in the top right to US West (Oregon).
3.) Select the "Volumes" subtab on the left hand side.
4.) Right click on the "Capstone2017" volume and hit "Create Snapshot".
5.) Note: any in progress writes to disk could be discarded by snapshot, to guaruntee correctness it is best to shut down the instance before creating the snapshot.


Restoring from a snapshot:
1.) Shut down the instance from the EC2 Dashboard.
2.) Go to the snapshots tab in EC2 Dashboard and right click on a snapshot.
3.) Create a new volume, make sure the volume availability zone is the same as the instance availability zone.
4.) Right click on the volume currently attached to the instance and hit "detatch volume".
5.) Right click on the volume created from the snapshot and hit "attach volume" and mount to "/dev/sda1".
6.) Start the instance, it should now be running from the snapshot.
