To create a backup of our AWS instance, we use volume snapshots through the AWS management console.

1.) Log into the AWS management console and navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
2.) Make sure you set the region in the top right to US West (Oregon).
3.) Select the "Volumes" subtab on the left hand side.
4.) Right click on the "Capstone2017" volume and hit "Create Snapshot"
5.) Note: any in progress writes to disk could be discarded by snapshot, to guaruntee correctness it is best to shut down the instance before creating the snapshot.
