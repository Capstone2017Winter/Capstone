The project is for simple benchmarking of HTTP GET requests on a webserver.

The project depends on libcurl (included with the source). To build libcurl, cd into the HTTPBench/curl directory and then run:

1.) "make" to build the library
1.1) "make test" if you want to run the tests
2.) "sudo make install" to install the library
3.) "sudo ldconfig" to update the linker so it can find the newly built library


To build HTTPBench cd into HTTPBench/ and then run:

1.) "make"
