/*The following functions are MicroC/OS-II system call
 * error handling appropriate for development.  If the error_code is not 0,
 * an error has occurred, and the scheduling is turned off while the error is 
 * processed.  Depending on the severity  level, as determined by the value 
 * set for FAULT_LEVEL, either control is returned to the task, the task is 
 * deleted, or the system scheduler is suspended.
 * 
 * In a deployed embedded system, errors must be 
 * handled according to the data storage and communications capabilities of
 * embedded hardware platform.  For example, a JTAG UART requires a host PC to
 * receive the JTAG commnand, and a serial UART requires a terminal at the end
 * of the terminal to receive the commands.  Development PCs and terminals 
 * normally do not exist in an embedded system.  
 * 
 * The manner in which the errors are resolved also changes in deployed embedded
 * systems.  While developing, it is desireable to have the system halt task 
 * activity and report an error message, so that the developer can study the 
 * context in which the error occurred.  The scheduler is locked so that the 
 * developer can read the error message written to standard out (or standard
 * error), without having the message garbled by having messages from other 
 * tasks interleaved on the output device.
 * 
 *    In a live deployed system, it is desireable not to disable the scheduler.  
 * To minimize task latency, th scheduler should not be locked while an error is 
 * processed. Worst case, the embedded system hardware should be power cycled, 
 * so that it can recover on its own.  Some intelligent checking in the error 
 * handler can take a less severe error recovery method, such as deleting and 
 * restarting only the errant task,  or by freeing up resources required by 
 * the errant task so that it may continue.  In addition, errors should be 
 * logged to some form of persistent data storage in a deployed embedded system 
 * so that a log of activity is available to the engineer who may have to 
 * resolve a critical failure in the field.
 * 
 * The purpose of this development error handler is to simply alert the 
 * developer that a task has encountered a problem by writing error details 
 * to standard output, and then hold the task in a busy loop so that a 
 * developer can study the cause of the error.
 * 
 * A MicroC/OS-II system call passes an output value or sets a return value 
 * with some status other than "OK".  The implementation of MicroC/OS-II 
 * terminates the task or halts the system.  In a deployed embedded 
 * application, there should be some attempt made to recover from errors 
 * from system calls where possible, by recreating the task which caused the 
 * error, or resetting the entire application if necessary.  If any means exist,
 * the error should be logged, such as to a local persistent memory store, or
 * to an external data collection device.  Some embedded applications even send
 * errors out over the internet for handling by a central facility.  This 
 * function has an error class input to classify the error by application 
 * or system module.  This feature can also be used to controls the flow 
 * that is taken from different errors occurring at different locations in 
 * the application code.
