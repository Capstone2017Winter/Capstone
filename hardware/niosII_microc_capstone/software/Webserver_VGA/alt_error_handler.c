/*
 * The following functions are MicroC/OS-II system call
 * error handling appropriate for development.  If the error_code is not 0,
 * an error has occurred, and task scheduling is turned off while the error is 
 * processed.  Depending on the severity  level, as determined by the value 
 * set for FAULT_LEVEL (NONE, TASK, or SYSTEM), either control is returned to 
 * the task, the task is deleted, or the system scheduler is suspended,
 * respectively.
 * 
 * In a deployed embedded system, errors must be 
 * handled according to the data storage and communications capabilities of an
 * embedded hardware platform.  For example, a JTAG UART requires a host PC to
 * receive the JTAG UART printf command, and a serial UART requires a device 
 * at the end of the cable to display the output.  Development PCs and 
 * terminals normally do not exist in a deployed embedded system, so other 
 * means of logging the error must be used.  
 * 
 * The manner in which errors are resolved also changes in deployed embedded
 * systems.  While developing, it is desireable to have the system halt task 
 * activity and report an error message so that the developer can study the 
 * context in which the error occurred.  The scheduler is locked so that the 
 * developer can read the error message written to standard out (or stderr), 
 * without having the message garbled by having messages from other tasks 
 * interleaved on the output device, or scrolled out of view by other task 
 * console output.
 * 
 * In a live deployed system, it is desireable not to disable the scheduler.  
 * To minimize task latency, the scheduler should not be locked while the error 
 * is processed. Worst case, the embedded system hardware should be power-
 * cycled, so that it can recover on its own.  Some intelligent checking in the 
 * error handler can take a less severe error recovery method, such as deleting 
 * and restarting only the errant task,  or by freeing up resources required by 
 * the errant task so that it may continue.  In addition, errors should be 
 * logged to some form of persistent data storage in a deployed embedded system 
 * so that a log of activity is available 
 * to the engineer who may have to resolve a critical failure in the field.
 * 
 * The purpose of this development error handler is to simply alert a developer
 * that a task has encountered a problem by writing error details to standard 
 * output, so that a developer can study the cause of the error.
 * 
 * A MicroC/OS-II system call passes an output value or sets a return value 
 * with some status other than "OK".
 * cases.  The implementation of MicroC/OS-II
 * application error handlers take the following actions based on the fault
 * status:
 * 
 * Fault Status           Action
 * ------------           ------
 * TASK                   Terminates the task
 * SYSTEM                 Halts the scheduler, enters an endless loop
 * NONE                   Returns control to the application task
 *  
 * In a deployed embedded systems application, there should be some attempt made 
 * to recover from errors where possible, by recreating task which caused the 
 * error in the case of a TASK fault level, or resetting the entire application, 
 * if necessary due to a SYSTEM fault level.  In addition, if any means exist,
 * the error should be logged, such as to a local persistent memory store, or
 * to an external data collection device.  Some embedded applications even send
 * errors out over the internet for handling by a central facility.  This error
 * handling function to invoke should be chosen based on whether errors are the 
 * result of the application only, or MicroC/OS-II system call.
 * 
 *    Additional extensions can be made to the use of EXPANDED_DIAGNOSIS
 * value for error_code.  This feature could also be used to control the flow 
 * that is taken from different errors occurring at different locations in the 
 * application code.  For example, instead of using the expanded_diagnosis_ptr 
 * as a string to be printed, as it is used below, the expanded_diagnosis_ptr 
 * could point to a different function to be invoked, or it could point to a
 * structure which contains several items for analysis, including multiple
 * function pointers to be invoked based on other structure elements which 
 * indicate the state of the application at the time of the failure.  This 
 * extensibility capability for a variety of overloaded uses is the reason 
 * for declaration of the expanded_diagnosis_ptr as void *.
